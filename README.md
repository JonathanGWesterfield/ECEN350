#ECEN 350

All work this Computer Architecture class is in ARMv8. 

We switched from MIPS to ARMv8 a semester ago so this is some really fresh 
new material.

This repo contains all of the work that I did in ECEN 350 (or at least the 
stuff that I thought was pertinent). The assembly labs weren't really that 
difficult execpt for
the rescursion lab. For the verilog single cycle processor, the only hard 
lab was lab 9 in which we had to have a fully functioning single cycle 
processor implemented in verilog. It wasn't conceptually difficult, there 
were just a lot of places for hidden bugs to come up and was really 
difficult to find where the issues were.
