# ECEN 350

All work this for this Computer Architecture class is in LEGv8, a teaching subset language of ARMv8. 

We switched from MIPS to ARMv8 a semester ago so this is some really fresh 
new material.

This repo contains all of the work that I did in ECEN 350 (or at least the 
stuff that I thought was pertinent). The assembly labs weren't really that 
difficult execpt for
the rescursion lab (lab 4). For the verilog single cycle processor, the only hard 
lab was lab 9 in which we had to have a fully functioning single cycle 
processor implemented in verilog. It wasn't conceptually difficult, there 
were just a lot of places for hidden bugs to come up and was really 
difficult to find where the issues were.

I used iVerilog (Icarus Verilog) to compile all of my modules, then used VCS to generate my waveforms for the verilog portion. Icarus verilog can be downloaded on Mac using Homebrew (by far the easiest method), with Linux (using the standard package managers), and Windows (I think).
